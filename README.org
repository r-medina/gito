#+TITLE: gito


Tool for managing source code more like =go get= - that is to say,
with opinions on where code should live.

The value add of this will be that it will make finding code and
navigating to it easier.


What it will look like:
#+begin_src text
  gito get github.com/r-medina/gito # defults to GOPATH[0]/src/github.com/...
  gito where r-medina/gito # $HOME/go/src/github.com/r-medina/gito

  gito where r-medina/gito # > path

  cd $(gito where r-medina/gito)
  cd $(gito where gito)

  gito set r-medina/gito path # saves the location information to path
  gito get github.com/somelonngname/repo
  cd $(gito where repo)

  gito url gito # https://github.com/r-medina/gito
#+end_src


will put everything in the first directory listed by $GOPATH

[[https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#SplitList][filepath.SplitList]] for splitting PATH style variables

* Thoughts

  might actually be useful to run its own database

  default location is in GOPATH, optional argument for path

  thinking of using urfave/cli

  mkdir -p: https://gobyexample.com/directories
